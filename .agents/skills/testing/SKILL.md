description: What to test, where the tests live, how to run them, and what makes a test worth keeping.
when-to-use: Any change that adds or alters behaviour, any bug fix, and any change something else depends on. A behaviour change with no test is unfinished work.

# Testing

## What to write

- Every behaviour change gets a test that fails before the change and passes after it. For a bug fix, write the failing test first and keep it — the bug is not fixed if nothing would catch it coming back.
- Cover the happy path, the validation or error path, and at least one boundary: empty, maximum, malformed, duplicated.
- Test the contract, not the implementation: given this input, this output or this failure. A test that breaks when the internals are refactored is testing the wrong thing.
- Prefer parameterised or table-driven cases over copy-pasted blocks — one case per line, with the expectation visible.
- **Never** write a test that can pass for the wrong reason: no assertions that a call happened without checking what it returned, no `assert True`, no snapshot nobody reads.
- Deterministic above all: no wall-clock time, no randomness, no network, no dependence on file ordering or locale. Inject or freeze what you cannot control.
- Fast and local: mock the network and filesystem boundaries instead of calling them. A suite nobody runs is a suite that rots.

## Where they live

- Follow the placement convention the repository already uses; if it has none, put the test next to the code it verifies and say so in the pull request.
- Test data belongs with the test, named for the case it covers. Do not commit a fixture that another test would silently depend on.
- A harness that is code is code: written in the repository's own language and run with its package manager, not as a shell script of commands.

## Running them

- The repository has two commands and this skill has neither of them written down: the narrow test command for while you are iterating, and the check command for the final tree. Run the narrow one first, the check command before you hand the work off, and quote its output — a report of either without the command and the tree it ran against is not a verification.
- If the repository has no test command at all, say that in the handoff instead of claiming coverage.
- A test that passes only sometimes is a broken test. Fix it or delete it in the same change — **never** retry until green, and never mark a flaky test as expected failure to get past a gate.
